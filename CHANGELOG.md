 **Initial Release**
 
Octus SDK uses advanced deep learning technologies for accurate and fast ID scanning and OCR. Businesses can integrate the Octus SDK into native iOS Apps which comes with pre-built screens and configurations. The SDK returns the scanned images, extracted data and error codes. And as a safety measure, the SDK does not store any of the personal data or ID images that are scanned.
